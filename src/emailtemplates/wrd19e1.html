        Hey {FirstName}!</p>
    <p>
        We hope you had a great experience taking the Microsoft Word 2019 Level 1 course.<br />
        To help you with your preparation, we&#39;re sending you the Practical Exam Kit, which includes a practice file and some instructions on how to do the exam.</p>
    <h2 style="color: #a9cd40;">
        Getting Started</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="https://aolccbc.com/examkits?kit=wrd19e1">Click on this link to download the kit.</a></li>
        <li>
            Open the downloaded file.</li>
        <li>
            Follow the steps to put the kit in a new folder on your desktop called &quot;{FirstName} Exam Folder.&quot;</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The practical exam instructions will guide you on how to change things in the practical exam file. Once you make those changes, you need to copy the exam code from the file in the kit called &quot;EXAM_CODE.txt.&quot; Then, you need to go online to start your exam by pasting the exam code on the exam page.</p>
    <p>
        During the exam, you&#39;ll be able to refer to the practical exam file and the program&#39;s help feature if you need help with Course Content questions.</p>
    <h2 style="color: #a9cd40;">
        Exam Details</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The exam is closed book, like most of our courses.</li>
        <li>
            To pass the exam, you need to get at least 75%.</li>
        <li>
            The exam should take about an hour, so take your time and read the questions carefully.</li>
        <li>
            If you have any questions, call us, and we&#39;ll help you out.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        You get two chances to take the exam for free, and you can get up to 89% on your second try. If you need a third try, you&#39;ll have to pay $30, and the highest score you can get is 89%. If you fail the third time, you&#39;ll have to pay to take the whole course again.</p>
    <p>
        Remember, it&#39;s really important to finish the practice file before you take the exam. Half the questions on the exam are about the practice file, so if you don&#39;t finish it, the highest grade you can get is 50%.</p>
    <p>
        We wish you the best of luck in taking your exam, and we hope that you find the Practical Exam Kit helpful. If you have any questions, please let us know.</p>
