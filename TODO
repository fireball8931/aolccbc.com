Create a CSV file that lists the names of all the programs and the credential that is issued upon completion of the course, as well as the tuition and fees for both domestic and international students.
    Update the Python script or convert it to be usable by an npm run script.
    Consolidate the data as there are two different sets of data that you get.

Convert the program name into a URL-friendly format so you can refer to the image and smorg (internal name for syllabus). Each program should have highlights, admissions requirements, career opportunities, a simplified list of courses, salary range for the NOC (National Occupation Code) for the program, type of credential, length of program in weeks and hours. The program page should also include a link to a prepared PDF file with all this same info that has already been taken care of.

    Poll various government APIs to grab job titles and salary ranges to include in the program pages.

Use some sort of database file that can be edited separately or expand the CSV file to contain all the details.

When you build the site using node.js libraries, you can generate the program HTML pages using a templating engine such as ParcelJS.

Create an eye-catching index/table of contents page that showcases all the programs. A featured program slideshow would be at the top, just below the navbar for the site.
